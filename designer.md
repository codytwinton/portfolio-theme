      Graphic design is my passion. Since I was young, I've been captivated by creativity and the arts. Realizing my love for design, I participated in two mentorships. Since then, I have worked as a freelance designer. I've had the opportunity to work with clients such as non-profits, brick and mortar shops, and food trucks.

      I'm skilled in Adobe Illustrator, and have had experience in Adobe Photoshop and InDesign. My love for people has lead me to collaboration with others - from gathering inspiration, to designing concepts, to creating cohesive products.

      As I continue my career as a designer, I desire to learn and work with others.
