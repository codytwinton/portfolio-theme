Meals OnCol is a non-profit that provides support to those undergoing cancer treatment by delivering them nutritious meals. Founder Allison Litton, DrPH requested a logo that was both simple and clean in appearance. I began my process by considering the direction and key attributes of this organization. Then, I sketched multiple logo options, followed by designing vectors, and finally presenting options to the company board. I continued to work until the visual representation of this organization was complete.

Once the branding was finished, I designed and printed marketing material: flyers, cards, magnets, and stationary.
